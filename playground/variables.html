    Var and Let can be reused. 
    For example you can redeclare variable first and when you redeclare you do not use the term var again.

    Use strict at top of javascript makes it so that you need to strictly adhere to JS principles.
    For example the below call of dog will not work because it has not been defined in a variable.
    */

      /*
    SCOPING
    Let and Const are block scoped amd Var are fxn scoped.
    Let and Const came about in ES6 and Var has been around forever.
    It is good practice to default to const then if you need to change a value of a variable you should then use let.
    */
      /*
    NAMING CONVENTION
    Not recommended to use a capital letter. You should use alphabet and you can also use $ or _ symbols however they are common in jQuery
    and Lodash libraries, respectively.
    For two words variables should be camel cased for example: const camelCase = 'Camels';
    You can also use underscores for SNAKE CASE.
    There is also KEBAB CASE which uses hyphens and is NOT allowed in JS.
